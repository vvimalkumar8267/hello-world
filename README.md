# What to accomplish in web design?

As a Software QA Engineer, It was always about finding issues. As a result, it stimulated my curiosity in finding solutions to the problems. Hence, I'd like to learn about graphic design ideas that apply to web design, as well as how to put theories into reality. I'm here to broaden my understanding of the principles needed to improve UI/UX of mobile and web applications.
